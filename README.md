# 422-uart-link

This project contains a schematic and a board for a RS-422 to UART standard converter incorporating a Texas Instruments module DS8921. 
It turned out to be a purely educational eagle project because ready-made converters are far cheaper and widely available in oppostion to DS8921 chips.

This converter was supposed to be used in a wireless long distance bridge, transforming a typical Lowrance cable echosounder to a wireless one, 
which would allow it to be used in a bait boat.
